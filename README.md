# is-abn

Validation for Australian Business Numbers.

## Installation

is-abn supports use from both the browser and as a node module. In either case just import /src/is-abn.js however you normally would.

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 5+
- Firefox 3+
- IE9+/Edge
- Opera 10.50+
- Safari 4.0.5+

## Future Todo
- Support older browsers
- Add unit tests
- Add JSCS style guide
- Build/minify source

## Contributing
For now, please just try to keep the current style if you make any changes, and (once I have some unit tests in place) add/modify unit tests as needed.

A JSCS config file will be added soon.
